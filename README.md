About the Python Projects:

*Notice: To run the python files,  enter "python .py" in command line/unix.
1. ImageEditing: Place an image file in the folder and replace the image at line 506 to run the program.
2. Othello_AI: Allows the user to face a computer in a game of othello.
3. Railroard(TSP): Testing the algorithms of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Run Tsp.py for the full verison.
4. Sudoku(optimized): Runs a total of 128 Sudoku problems on the program, where the program (optimized) would attempt to solve them all as fast as possible. Change the code in lines 19-20 to change what range of problems the program should solve.
5. Synchronization: Synchs all the dots to blink at the same time.
6. WordChallenger_AI: Allows the user to challenge the computer to a game of word completion, where the one who types the last letter of a word loses.
7. WordLadder(BFS,DFS): Uses BFS, DFS, and other algorithms in order to execute Word Ladder. Modify lines 79 - 80 to check the word path from word to word.
